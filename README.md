# Wasmtime Demos

This repository is now subsumed by the upstream wasmtime repository at
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime.

Historically this repository had a work-in-progress demo of the "Interface
Types" proposal circa 2019 which has long since evolved past this point (as well
as Wasmtime itself). None of the demos here still work today and most, if not
all, of the design around the demos has significantly changed. Nowadays it's
recommended to explore:

* [Wasmtime itself](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)
* [The Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model)

It is not recommended to use what's here in this repository for anything else
nowadays, instead feel free to reach out on those repositories with questions
and/or requests.
